# Common Documentation

This directory contains common documentation resources that are shared across multiple parts of the project. These resources provide standardized information, guidelines, and references that can be used throughout the dotfiles repository.

## Purpose

The common documentation serves several key purposes:

- Providing consistent terminology and definitions
- Establishing shared conventions and standards
- Offering reusable documentation components
- Centralizing frequently referenced information

## Contents

The common documentation includes:

- Terminology definitions
- Standard conventions
- Common procedures
- Shared references
- Cross-cutting concerns

## Usage

When creating new documentation or updating existing documents, refer to the common documentation to ensure consistency across the project. You can reference these documents directly or include them as dependencies in your documentation.

```bash
# Example: Including common terminology in your documentation
# (using a hypothetical include mechanism)
include "../common/terminology.md"
```

## Contributing

When adding to the common documentation:

1. Ensure the information is truly common and used across multiple areas
2. Follow the established formatting and style guidelines
3. Cross-reference related documentation
4. Keep the information concise and focused

Common documentation should be reviewed regularly to ensure it remains relevant and accurate as the project evolves.
